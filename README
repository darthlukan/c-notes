// This is simply a small program that I'm using as a live notes setup to
// practice programming concepts in C.  It's not meant to be useful as anything
// other than a tool to help me remember stuff that is easily forgotten.  I'm
// putting it up on GitHub so that I don't lose it and so that others can use
// it as reference material.
//
// I am also including exercises that I have completed or am currently working
// on completing from the book by Zed Shaw, Learn C The Hard Way.
